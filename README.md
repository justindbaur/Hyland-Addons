# Hyland-Addons

To use this library you can download it onto your machine and build it yourself, it was built in Visual Studio 2019 and nothing special has been used.

To use the test project you will need to add your own App.config file with the following app settings keys:
* LoginUsername
* LoginPassword
* Datasource
* ServiceUrl

All of these must point to your OnBase instance.  Some tests may still not work though because it relies on WorkView objects that are in my system.
